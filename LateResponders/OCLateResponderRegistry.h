/**
 The late responder registry.
 This class maintains an order list of late responders -- the late responder chain -- sorted by their weight.
 
 Clients will usually hook the late responder chain somewhere in their app's regular responder chain as after  NSWindow/UIWindow or some view controller.
 
 For example, to hook this chain after the a window, a client would set nextResponder of their window (on iOS this requires subclassing) to the initialResponder,
 and set the nextResponder of lastResponder to whatever was the nextResponder of the window previously.
